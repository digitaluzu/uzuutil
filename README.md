# UzuUtil

A set of utility scripts for use with [Unity Engine](https://unity3d.com) projects.

These scripts have been used in most [Digital Uzu](http://digitaluzu.com) apps ([BEAT DRIFT](http://beatdrift.com), Tiny Tapper, etc) and on numerous platforms including iOS, Windows Phone, and Android (Google Play, OUYA, GameStick).

The scripts have been open-sourced in the hopes that they can be beneficial to other developers. Dependencies are minimal, so feel free to use them all or to pick and choose certain ones.

Enjoy! :sparkles:

# Usage
Import script(s) into the appropriate Unity directory within your project for compilation (usually the `Scripts` directory).

## Requirements
* Unity 4.3+
