# UzuUtil

A set of utility scripts for use with [Unity Engine](https://unity3d.com) projects.

These scripts have been used in most [Digital Uzu](http://digitaluzu.com) apps ([BEAT DRIFT](http://beatdrift.com), Tiny Tapper, etc) and on numerous platforms including iOS, Windows Phone, and Android (Google Play, OUYA, GameStick). :muscle:

The scripts have been open-sourced in the hopes that they can be beneficial to other developers. Dependencies are minimal, so feel free to use all the scripts or to pick and choose certain ones.

Enjoy! :sparkles:

# Usage
Import script(s) into the appropriate Unity directory within your project for compilation (usually `Scripts` directory).

## Requirements
* Unity 4.3+
